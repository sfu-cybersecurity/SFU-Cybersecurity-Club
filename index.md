Hi, welcome to the SFU Cybersecurity Community (SFUC2)!

SFUC2 is an educational group focused on theoretical and practical aspects of cybersecurity initiated by students in Professional Computer Science program. The group will help raise awareness on Cybersecurity and also share knowledge in weekly meetups in addition to hands-on activities.

We are open to everyone with interest in Computer Security and want to work on their ethical hacking skills. Basic programming/scripting knowledge and familiarity with Linux will really help but isn't mandatory!
